Python implementation of the paper "A*Prune: An Algorithm for Finding K Shortest Paths Subject to Multiple Constraints".

## Disclaimer

This is NOT an official implementation or repository and the code is not thoroughly tested.

I found some mistakes in the original pseudocode and have made some adjustments and modifications in the code.

You may find them in the `main.py` where I made some comments nearby.

Raise an issue or pull request if you have any doubts or better implementation.
